CHANGES:
gnome-shell switched ES6 classes, this breaks _all_ plugins
rename gnome-games -> meta
gnome-system-log got retired, upstream had hard dependancy on systemd

gnome-control-center now has device name and OS name fields filled in.
There is still a issue with the hashtable....

Vino, vinagre and ekiga where dropped from the gnome3 meta port, they aren't really maintained upstream atm.

Drop obsolete usage of gnome-icon-theme and -symbolic.
